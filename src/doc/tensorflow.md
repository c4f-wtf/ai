# Tensorflow

```javascript
import { tf } from 'lib/tensorflow.js';
```

While the whole [tensorflowjs](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) library is available using the tf namespace, there is currently no editor integration (autocompletion etc...). It is on the Todo list, but there is no estimate when it will be done.

*If you want to help, i just need a single .d.ts file with all the type information. Theoretically this should be easy to autogenerate, but it somehow failed and i didn't have enough time to fix it yet...*
